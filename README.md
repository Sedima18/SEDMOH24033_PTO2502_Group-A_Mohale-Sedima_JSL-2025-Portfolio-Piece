# JSL Portfolio Piece: Kanban App Deployment & Features Implementation

## Overview

This project involves **deploying a Kanban app to Netlify**, ensuring the app's functionality and persistence through local storage, and implementing dynamic features such as task editing, deletion, sidebar interaction, and a theme toggle. The goal is to deliver a fully functional, deployable application that is responsive across devices and maintains data consistency. Students will also focus on **clean, modular code** that is well-documented for future development.

## WHAT to Submit

## Before You Begin

**Check out the [Figma Reference File](https://www.figma.com/design/y7bFCUYL5ZHfPeojACBXg2/Challenges-%7C-JSL?node-id=6033-11092&t=XbQhBWPYxXDAqp3x-1) and the project user stories in your student dashboard** before you start building.

## Key Objectives

### Deployment & Hosting

- **Prepare the Kanban app files** for deployment, ensuring the project structure aligns with best practices for deployment.
- **Deploy the Kanban app to Netlify**, following the process of uploading your project and setting a custom deployment link.
- Test the deployed app to ensure that all features, including task creation, editing, local storage, and sorting, work as expected in a live environment.

### Initial Data Fetching & Loading State

- **Fetch tasks dynamically** from an API: https://jsl-kanban-api.vercel.app/

- **Replace any hard-coded task data**, to ensure the application receives the most up-to-date tasks.

- **Display a loading message** while the tasks are being fetched so that users are informed the data is loading.
- If fetching fails, **show an error message** to alert users to the issue.

### Data Persistence

- **Store fetched tasks in local storage** to ensure data persists across page reloads.
- On startup, **load tasks from local storage** and display them in their respective columns (To Do, Doing, Done) to maintain an organized task board.

### Task Editing & Deletion

- Allow users to **edit task details** (title, description, status) in a modal. Upon saving, the task should reflect the updated data on the board and in local storage.
- Implement a **delete button** within the modal to allow users to remove tasks. A confirmation message should appear before deleting a task, and if confirmed, the task will be removed from both the task board and local storage.

### Sidebar Interaction

- Implement a **sidebar** that contains all required elements as shown in the Figma design.
- Allow the sidebar to be **toggleable**, so users can hide or show it based on their preferences.
- Provide a mobile version of the sidebar that can be **accessed from the app logo**, and ensure it matches the design and functionality of the desktop sidebar.

### Mobile Sidebar (Menu) Functionality

- On mobile, the sidebar should function as a **menu** accessible from the top of the screen.
- Include the **theme toggle** switch in the mobile menu and ensure all features match the desktop sidebar, as shown in the Figma design.
- Ensure that the mobile menu is **closable**, allowing users to dismiss it for an unobstructed view of the tasks.

### Theme Toggle (Dark/Light Mode)

- Include a **theme toggle switch** to allow users to switch between dark mode and light mode.
- The toggle should be functional in both the **desktop sidebar** and the **mobile menu** for consistent theme switching across devices.
- Ensure all elements of the **Kanban board** are styled appropriately in dark mode, ensuring good contrast and readability.

### Stretch Goal: Adding Priority (Optional)

Enhance your task management application by introducing a **priority system**. Users should be able to select a priority level—**High, Medium, or Low**—when creating or editing tasks. The priority should be:

- **Visually displayed** on each task card as shown on the Figma design to clearly communicate urgency.
- **Saved to local storage** to ensure persistence across page reloads.
- **Editable** so users can adjust a task's importance as needed.
- **Reflected immediately** on the UI upon changes.
- **Sorted automatically** within each status column by priority (High → Medium → Low), with **High-priority tasks appearing at the top**.
- **Persistently ordered**, maintaining correct priority display after refreshing the page.

## Code Quality & Maintainability

- **Break the code into separate modules** with clear responsibilities (e.g., local storage handling, task rendering, modal management) to improve maintainability and scalability.
- Use **descriptive, meaningful variable and function names** to make the code easy to understand.
- **Document every major function and module** using **JSDoc comments** to explain the purpose, parameters, and return values of each part of the code.

## Expected Outcome

A fully functional Kanban app that:

- Dynamically fetches and displays tasks.
- Supports task editing, deletion, and persistent storage through local storage.
- Has a responsive, mobile-friendly sidebar with a theme toggle switch.
- App deployed to **Netlify** with a custom, readable URL.
- Uses modular, well-documented code that is easy to maintain and scale.



## Kanban Board final Portfolio Piece! 

## Overview of the app
 
- * This app displays tasks across three columns—To Do, Doing, and Done—with a Figma-inspired UI. On first load, it fetches initial data from an API (or a local fallback), stores it in localStorage, and then runs entirely from the browser for fast, offline-friendly usage.

## Features

- *Initial Data Fetch + Caching

Fetch tasks from a configurable API endpoint on first load.

Cache the response in localStorage and subsequently boot from cache.

- Task CRUD

Add new tasks via a modal (title, description, status).

Edit tasks by clicking a card, modifying fields in the modal, and saving.

Delete tasks with a confirm action.

- State Persistence

All changes are persisted to localStorage using a single source-of-truth key.

- Sidebar Controls

Show/Hide sidebar on desktop.

On mobile, sidebar becomes an overlay that can be opened/closed with a button or backdrop tap.

- Theme Toggle

Seamless Dark/Light mode toggle; preference saved to localStorage.

- Task Counts

Column headers show dynamic task counts per status.

- Keyboard & A11y niceties

Esc closes modals/overlays.

Focus trapping inside modal when open.

Buttons/inputs have accessible labels.

## Tech Stack
- HTML5, CSS3 

- JavaScript 

## How It Works
- Boot

Check localStorage for kanban.tasks.

If present, render from cache.

If absent, fetch(API_URL), validate/normalize tasks, save to localStorage, then render.

- Render

Split tasks by status into the three columns.

Update column counts.

- Mutations (Add/Edit/Delete)

Open modal → update in-memory array → write to localStorage → re-render.

- Sidebar / Theme

Toggling updates the DOM (CSS classes) and saves preferences to localStorage.

## Usage Guide
- Add a Task
Click “+ Add New Task”.
Fill Title, optional Description, choose Status.
Click Create Task.
The task appears in the selected column and is saved persistently.

- Edit a Task
Click a task card.
The modal opens pre-filled.
Update fields and click Save Changes.

- Delete a Task
Click a task card → Delete.
Confirm deletion in the prompt.
Task is removed and counts update automatically.

- Toggle Dark/Light Mode
Click the sun/moon button in the sidebar.
The choice is remembered for next visits.

- Show/Hide Sidebar
Desktop: Click the Hide Sidebar button; layout expands.
Mobile: Tap the menu icon to open; tap the backdrop or close icon to hide.
